Here the lie files which I, koalagang, no longer have any use for but wish to keep either for others or in case I ever want to revisit the respective software.\
**DISCLAIMER:** these files are not necessarily compatible with the latest versions of the respective software so expect breakages if you plan to use any of them. You will likely need to modify them slightly or just take snippets of them and add them to your own config.
