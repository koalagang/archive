Here the lie files which I no longer have any use for but wish to keep either for others to view or in case I ever want to revisit any of them myself.
**DISCLAIMER:** these files are not necessarily compatible with the latest versions of the respective software so expect breakages if you plan to use any of them. You will likely need to modify them slightly or just take snippets of them and add them to your own config.\
These configs are mostly unmaintained so proceed with caution if you plan to use them and make sure that you are aware of what you are doing; especially if any of them modify your entire system.
